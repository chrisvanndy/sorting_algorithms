Sorting Algorithms + Big 0

Task 0: Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n²) on average to worst case, and O(n) in best case.

Task 1: Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is an easy-to-implement, stable sorting algorithm with time complexity of O(n²) on average to worst case, and O(n) in the best case.

Task 2: Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

Task 3: Quick Sort
To sort an array of n distinct elements, quicksort takes O(n log n) time in expectation, averaged over all n! permutations of n elements with equal probability.
